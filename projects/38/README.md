# Project 38: Single Cell Multi-Omics Analysis

## Abstract

Rapid improvements in DNA sequencing technology in the last decade have yielded a wealth of molecular information. The potential insights from multi-omic analysis, including single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) are not being delayed by experimental assay availability, but by access and navigability of computational analytics. There is an immediate need for educational resources and easy-to-navigate computational tools to help address this gap, and to provide roadmaps for complex analytics. Google Cloud’s goal is to empower current and researchers to conduct Single Cell Multi-Omics analysis so they can address some of biology’s most pressing questions, educate the next generation of researchers and focus their attention on chasing down biological mechanisms of the world’s most pressing diseases. Cloud technologies offer next-generation resources, increased computational analytics, and most importantly a teaching platform that extends to a wide-range of scientists and students regardless of previous computational background. At Google Cloud, we can present tools to junior and senior researchers, to teach both experimental and computational researchers how to conduct custom analysis with Cloud AI Notebooks, the possibilities of automated end-to-end analysis with Cloud integration technologies, and to introduce a wider community to the available possibilities of Artificial Intelligence currently available with Google Cloud.

## Expected outcomes

We believe that the combined powers of innovative computational tools, technology access and an inclusive scientific community will lead to pivotal research findings in the Single Cell Multi-Omics scientific community.
Our goals are to inspire a diverse community of researchers to tackle Single Cell Multi-Omics analysis, learn the fundamentals of molecular biology analysis with Google Cloud and create an environment for scientists to
network with other researchers. We also expect some creative solutions and approaches to running Multi-Omics analysis with Cloud computing tools, since it’s an emerging space beyond currently available tools for genomic analysis.

## Expected audience

It would be great to invite an academic researcher and a Google Research Scientist who are actively involved with Single Cell and/or Multi-Omics Analysis research. If selected, we are happy to provide a list of researchers
who have appropriate domain expertise and experience
