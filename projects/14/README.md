# Project 14: Nightingale – modular web components for visualisation of biological data

## Abstract

Nightingale is a set of open-source, reusable, composable, and extendable components to visualise biological data and implemented following web standards. Their main focus is visualising biological sequences information.

Nightingale was born out of the visualisation needs of UniProt, InterPro, and PDBe (all being ELIXIR Core Data Resources) and expanded to accommodate the requirements of other resources such as Open Targets. The Biohackathon would provide a fertile ground to collect new use cases, and would allow us to improve the definition of our component APIs adhering to ubiquitous web standards so they can be used by the broader community.

While the aim of the Nightingale project is to cover the data visualisation aspect, the definition of common standards throughout the life science ecosystem is already a task that the BioSchemas community is undertaking. Therefore, a current Nightingale goal is to make this set of components consume data marked up with the Protein profile of BioSchemas using existing scrappers like BMUSE.
The open source nature of the project makes it challenging to find common time and space for growth, but the Biohackathon has previously provided that space for Nightingale and we hope to return in 2021 and improve Nightingale even further.
