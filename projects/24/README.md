# Project 24: Adapting and integrating RO-Crate for packaging research outputs and their metadata

## Abstract

RO-Crate <https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/> is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. It is based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wide variety of situations. An RO-Crate is a structured archive of all the items that contributed to the research outcome, including their identifiers, provenance, relations and annotations.

Within ELIXIR, RO-Crate is being established as the exchange mechanism for workflow definitions and workflow results with WorkflowHub, EOSC-Life infrastructure and ELIXIR Tools platform. We have also been building collaborations with the ELIXIR Cloud & AAI working group, Bioschemas, GA4GH, OpenAIRE and multiple H2020 projects. As a general purpose packaging framework for data and their metadata, RO-Crate is used across multiple areas, including bioinformatics, digital humanities and regulatory submissions.

In this hackathon we want to particularly focus on tooling for generating, validating and consuming RO-Crates, integration with new platforms and repositories, working closely with participants from existing ELIXIR efforts that are already adapting or showing interest in using RO-Crate. We will also be providing a “Bring Your Own Research Object” drop-in for hackathon participants new to RO-Crate.

## Expected outcomes

ELIXIR Biohackathon provides the RO-Crate community with an opportunity to not just work collaboratively on RO-Crate tooling, but also to engage with other developers and platform providers across the ELIXIR ecosystem, and combine efforts with other hackathon topics like Bioschemas, WorkflowHub, ELIXIR Cloud & AAI, bio.tools, Galaxy and CWL.

Outcomes depend partly on these collaborations, and could include:

* Bring Your Own Research Object (assists in sharing their research outputs packaged as RO-Crate, ad-hoc tutorials or code walk-throughs)
* Components of RO-Crate Validator (e.g. Command Line Tool, ShEx / SHACL schemas, JSON Schemas)
* Prototype of RO-Crate utilities (e.g: Publish RO-Crate to Zenodo w/DOI, Extract Bioschemas  to add to RO-Crate, Add Person by ORCID)
* Concepts for how RO-Crates can be consumed or constructed (e.g.: RO-Crate index (F in FAIR!), RO-Crate visualizer, Nested RO-Crates)
* Improvements to RO-Crate libraries (Python, Javascript, Ruby)
* RO-Crate integrations (e.g. Galaxy, BioCompute Object, Nextflow/nf-core, Australian BioCommons, OpenAIRE, Zenodo, B2SHARE, GA4GH WES/DRS/TRS, FAIR Digital Objects, GitHub Actions
* RO-Crate Specification improvements (e.g. Table-based data, Frictionless Data alignment, Formalizing RO-Crate profiles)

## Expected audience

Participants expected span:

* Data/Workflow Platform developers (e.g. Galaxy, Zenodo)
* Tool maintainers/packagers
* Metadata/ontology experts (e.g. Bioschemas, JSON-LD)
* Python developers
* Ruby developers
* Researchers producing data

This topic involves partners from at least: ELIXIR-UK, ELIXIR-BE, ELIXIR-ES

**Number of expected hacking days**: 3-4 days
