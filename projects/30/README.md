# Project 30: Federated Learning and Machine Learning to power integrated diagnostics of breast cancer

## Abstract

The correct and comprehensive diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer is a basic prerequisite for choosing the best possible therapy. Owkin is pioneering AI in healthcare, by leveraging its collaborative federated learning software and expert AI capabilities to bring solutions to optimize drug development and improve patient care in oncology.

The goal of this challenge is to create the most accurate machine learning model for tile-level tumor classification in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSI) of lymph node sections. An accurate machine learning model for this task could be used for automated detection of metastases in WSI thereby reducing both the reading time of the pathologists and the subjectivity in diagnosis. The Camelyon 16 and Camelyon 17 challenge datasets provide tile-level annotated H&E stained whole slide images of lymph node sections drawn from breast cancer patients from 2 and 5 hospitals, respectively.


In the first part, this challenge will investigate this machine learning problem with data available in a single center. In a second part of the challenge, we will investigate the application of Federated Learning in healthcare. Federated learning is a new decentralized machine learning procedure to train machine learning models with multiple data providers. Instead of gathering data on a single server, the data remains locked on their servers and the algorithms and only the predictive models travel between the servers – never the data. We aim to demonstrate how  collaborative training further improves model performance over single-center training, by enabling the model to train on a larger amount of data. 
Our project will rely on the Federated Learning software developed by Owkin, [Owkin Connect](https://owkin.com/owkin-connect/). 
Participants will be able to use environmments with powerful GPUs in the cloud.

Through the HealthChain consortium, Owkin already showed the impact of Federated Learning to accelerate medical research. We established that ML models can be trained successfully with Owkin Connect on histology images, siloed at different clinical centers, to predict treatment responses in breast cancer.
