# Project 30: Federated Learning and Machine Learning to power integrated diagnostics of breast cancer

## Abstract

The correct and comprehensive diagnosis of breast cancer is a basic prerequisite for choosing the best possible therapy. Owkin is pioneering AI in healthcare, by leveraging its collaborative federated learning software and expert AI capabilities to bring solutions to optimize drug development and improve patient care in oncology

The goal of this challenge is to create the most accurate machine learning model for automated detection of metastases in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSI) of lymph node sections.  A successful automated solution would help reduce both the reading time of the pathologists and the subjectivity in diagnosis. The Camelyon 16 and Camelyon 17 challenge datasets provide the H&E stained whole slide images of lymph node sections drawn from breast cancer patients from 2 and 5 hospitals, respectively.

In a second part of the challenge, we will investigate the application of Federated Learning in healthcare. Federated learning is a new decentralized machine learning procedure to train machine learning models with multiple data providers. Instead of gathering data on a single server, the data remains locked on their servers and the algorithms and only the predictive models travel between the servers – never the data. We aim to demonstrate how  collaborative training further improves model performance over single-center training, by enabling the model to train on a larger amount of data. Our project will rely on the Federated Learning software developed by Owkin, [Owkin Connect](https://owkin.com/owkin-connect/).
