# Project 31: Application of genome graph for standard representation of structural variations in RDF

## Abstract

A project description:
Representation of structural variations (SVs) is one of the urgent issues for data sharing. Some databases already use the VCF format for this purpose. However, the way to serialize SVs is not standardized and the format will not be applicable for more complex SVs detected in the future. Meanwhile, the 'vg' tool that constructs and manipulates genome graphs has the capability to serialize any variations into the Resource Description Framework (RDF). In this proposal, we plan to apply the generic 'vg' RDF model for representing existing SVs to be standardized and extended for future complex SVs. As we have been developing knowledge graphs in RDF covering a diverse range of life sciences and biomedical datasets, the interpretation of SVs can be seamlessly realized.

Any people (two maximum) from Europe you would like to invite who are critical to the success of the project (name /institute/email):
* Jerven Bolleman (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics) <jerven.bolleman@sib.swiss>
* Erik Garrison (Sanger Institute/UC Santa Cruz) <erik.garrison@gmail.com>

The repository where the code will reside:
* To be decided (e.g., https://github.com/dbcls/visc)

## Team

### Lead(s)

Toshiaki Katayama (ktym@dbcls.jp, toshiaki.katayama@gmail.com)

## Expected outcomes

We will be able to summarize a set of different types of SVs represented in the standardized RDF during the hackathon, and also try to convert gnomAD SVs and/or dbVar.

## Expected audience

Human genome variation, genome database, variation data specification, variation genome graph, and Semantic Web experts.

**Number of expected hacking days**: Four days.
