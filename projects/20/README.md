# Project 20: Automating and interconnecting the ELIXIR Software Management Plan

## Abstract

The aim of the ELIXIR Software Best Practices task is to raise the Quality and Sustainability of research software by producing, promoting, measuring and adopting best practices applied to the software development life cycle. After capturing the community practices towards managing research software, this group has recently produced a draft of a software management plan (SMP), connected to a concise description of the guidelines for open research software.

The main goals of the proposed project are the following:
Do an initial mapping of the metrics captured by OpenEBench by connecting them to the corresponding SMP questions
Work on an initial design (and/or investigation of any existing solutions) for a software towards the automatic creation of a Software Management Plan
Connect to the CHAOSS initiative and the AUGUR tool, as related to the relevant services in the Tools Platform ecosystem.

In order to achieve these goals, this project will engage with key people active in OpenEBench and other relevant services of the ELIXIR Tools Ecosystem, in order to ensure that an appropriate level of understanding between the existing infrastructure and the proposed SMP questions are aligned.
