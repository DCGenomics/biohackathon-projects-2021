# Project 36: Mapping GA4GH Phenopackets and OHDSI OMOP for COVID-19 disease epidemics and analytics

## Abstract

The COVID-19 crisis demonstrates a critical requirement for rapid and efficient sharing of data to facilitate the global response to this and future pandemics. We can address this challenge by making viral genomic and patient phenomic data FAIR, and formalising it to permit seamless data integration for analysis.
Phenopackets is a standard file format for sharing phenotypic information that facilitates communication within the research and clinical genomics communities. The OMOP model allows for large-scale analysis of distributed data to generate evidence for research that promotes better health decisions and better care. This gathered data is used by epidemiologists to monitor the infection, model it and make outbreak analysis and predictions to evaluate policy interventions. To harness machine-learning and AI approaches to discover meaningful patterns in epidemic outbreaks, we need to ensure that data are FAIR. To leverage data for federated learning/analytics, datasets can be discovered in FAIR Data Points; FAIR data repositories that publish human- and machine-readable metadata for data resources. This project aims to enhance interoperability between health and research data by mapping Phenopackets and OMOP and representing COVID-19 metadata using the FAIR principles to enable discovery, integration and analysis of genotypic and phenotypic data.
