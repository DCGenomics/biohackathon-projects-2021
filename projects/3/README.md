# Project 3: Using MATLAB for BioHackathon

## Abstract

MathWorks will support BioHackathon teams that decide to use MATLAB, Simulink, or other MathWorks products for hacking any of the challenges submitted at the BioHackathon. Support will be provided in the form of a workshop license valid for the entire duration of the Hackathon which will include MATLAB Online, a browser based access to MATLAB as well as 5GB of storage on the cloud using MATLAB drive for each participant. Data from MATLAB Drive can be accessed from MATLAB Online and shared with other members of the team. In addition, GPUâ€™s for training Deep Learning Networks can also be made available. Participants are encouraged to provide an overview of their project using MATLAB Live Scripts which are computational notebooks with interactive controls that help in users learning about the algorithms by experimenting with parameters.

## Topics

Compute Platfrom
Data Platform
Interoperability Platform
Machine learning

**Project Number:** 3



**EasyChair Number:** 5

## Expected outcomes

There is no concrete expectation. MathWorks aims to support MATLAB users engaging in the BioHackathon. MATLAB has been used widely in Life Sciences research, especially in research on COVID-19 and the successfully completed projects can be made available to a broad community by linking the GitHub repositories onto File Exchange - the MathWorks platform for community tools.

## Expected audience

all participants of the BioHackathon could use MATLAB

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
