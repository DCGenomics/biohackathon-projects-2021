# Project 33: Implementation, testing and training on reference genome assembly pipelines for the eukaryotic tree of life

## Abstract

In the collaborative framework between the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), the European Reference Genome Atlas (ERGA) and the Galaxy community, we will bring together genome assembly experts to test existing pipelines and develop new assembly approaches for different different organisms representing the world living diversity such as vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, fungi. The goal is to generate guidelines for the optimal application of assembly pipelines for the scientific community and to make such pipelines accessible and reusable to a large number of users in Europe, hence the use of Galaxy framework. We will also develop training material and dedicated tutorials, by taking advantage of the lessons learned from the VGP, currently one of the most advanced groups of sequencing and assembly experts. The outcomes of the workshop will be disseminated via ERGA and VGP networks, through e.g. a webinar describing the content and usage of the workflows.
