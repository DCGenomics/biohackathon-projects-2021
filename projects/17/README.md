# Project 17: Beacon prototype implementation of electronic health data

## Abstract

The GA4GH Beacon protocol has evolved towards more complex applications with increased functionality. The extensions allow the query/filter for additional data beyond genome variants. Such filters are thought to be prefixed attributes, where they become the basis of scoping the value to the correct database value. This enables the possibility to implement the protocol to share aggregated information of other data types.

In a previous biohackathon (2020), we have explored the groundwork towards implementing of “Beacon for clinical/phenotypic data”, “Beacon for transcriptomic data” using the above-mentioned extension.

In this year’s biohackathon, we would like to move forwards and focus on (1) prototype implementation of electronic health record (EHR) data, and (2) linking a Beacon to a semantic data model for rare diseases (EJP-RD CDE). The first one is related to the creation of European Health Data Space: we aim to reach a working prototype implementation. The second one will allow for lighting a Beacon prototype to a model that has a semantic orientation. This biohackathon will be a good opportunity to strengthen the community as well as consolidate cross-resource collaboration between different institutions to facilitate the standardised sharing of aggregated information, which in turn will enhance the “Findability” of datasets.

## Expected outcomes

We look forward to the development of:
1)    A list of example queries on EHR data.
2)    Schemas of EHR data, linking to OMOP CDM.
3)   Implementation of API to report the existence and summary statistics of EHR data mapped to OMOP CDM.
4) A report on how EJ-RD CDE and Beacon model can be integrated

We are planning to submit a manuscript on Biohackathon outcome. Between the potential achievements, we could find an extended and lasting collaboration between institutions as well as scientific contributions, exploring the deployment of joint multi-institutional services.

## Expected audience

Bioinformaticians and developers working in the areas of API development, ontology, clinical and transcriptomics data processing/analysis.

By all means, organizers commit to the proposal with the participation and contribution of Beacon experts, developers, bioinformaticians for the event to ensure the presence of enough human resources and provide momentum during the biohackathon. 3 people from the University of Luxembourg, 2 from University of Leicester and 3 from CRG will participate in this Biohackathon topic.


**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
