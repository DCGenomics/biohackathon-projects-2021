# Project 15: CAB2: A step towards Biodiversity data enrichment

## Abstract

Linking molecular data to taxonomic names and their extensive taxonomic treatments represents a fundamental component in biodiversity assessment. Voucher specimens for sequenced data can be the key nodes to make these connections. During Biohackathon 2020, several projects investigated how sequence (meta)data could be retrieved from ENA and connected to taxonomic treatment or specimen databases like TreatmentBank and GBIF.

With this proposal, we aim to link more voucher specimens to sequences by applying machine learning techniques to specimen images, retrieving sequencing metadata physically on the specimen that can facilitate and maximize the linking process. We will then employ these metadata to improve the ENA linking process, allowing wider data discovery and enhancement. We also aim to develop a standard module to compare ENA, GBIF, and TB geographical data related to specific taxa and return the results in an interactive data exploration dashboard. The improvements will also address the gap-filling of gene names embedded in scientific papers relative to the accession numbers.

Results obtained in this project will reflect the importance of integrating different data sources in order to deliver consistent and complete biodiversity data to the scientific community and feed into European biodiversity projects such as Bioscan, BiCIKL and ERGA.
