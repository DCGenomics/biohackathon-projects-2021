# Project 11: Improve FAIR sharing for workflow systems using WorkflowHub and RO-Crate

## Abstract

WorkflowHub.eu is being established as a global workflow-language agnostic registry of life science computational workflows [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4605654]. Pre-launch in early 2020 was accelerated by the COVID-19 Biohackathon, along with close collaboration with EOSC-Life research infrastructure, and the registry now in public beta has expanded to support workflows across more than 30 different research groups and initiatives. We have co-evolved the community-developed data packaging standard RO-Crate [https://w3id.org/ro/crate/] and Bioschemas to support exchange and registration of complex workflows along with rich metadata and provenance, as well as their test and execution details with the LifeMonitor.
In this hackathon we aim to expand RO-Crate integration with other workflow systems such as Nextflow and Snakemake, in order to obtain what we have already achieved with Galaxy and CWL, and to expand the collection of workflows registered in WorkflowHub by means of collaborating with repository managers like nf-core [https://nf-co.re/] and Australian BioCommons [https://www.biocommons.org.au/] and helping individual users during the workflow integration process into RO-Crate packages and Workflowhub entries.
We will also be building a tighter integration with the Tools platform for detection of bio.tools and Bioconda/BioContainer usage within registered workflows, adding reverse registration for related workflows.

### Lead(s)

Ignacio Eguinoa (ignacio.eguinoa@gmail.com)

## Expected outcomes

New prototypes for workflow engine integrations with WorkflowHub, for instance Snakemake, Nextflow
Matured previous prototypes for integration, (Galaxy, CWL)
Draft of shared metadata model for workflow repositories (WorkflowHub, nf-core, Dockstore, Bioschemas)
Extend the collection and diversity of workflows entries registered at WorkflowHub.

## Expected audience

Workflow users (e.g. CWL, Nextflow, Galaxy, Snakemake)
Workflow engine developers
Platform developers (e.g. bio.tools)
Tool maintainers/packagers
Metadata/ontology experts (e.g. Bioschemas)
Python developers (to extend RO-Crate manipulation tools)
Ruby developers (WorkflowHub backend)

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
