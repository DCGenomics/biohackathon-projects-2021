# Project 19: Distributing macromolecular models using the 3D-Beacons network

## Abstract

We are developing 3D-Beacons, a collaborative project under the umbrella of the ELIXIR 3D-BioInfo Community. The primary objective of 3D-Beacons is to serve as a common portal that provides FAIR access to experimental and predicted protein structures, such that the data provenance is clear to the end-users.
Combining access to data resources that provide experimentally determined structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and template-based or ab initio models (e.g. Genome3D, SWISS-MODEL) will give the maximum possible coverage of the protein sequence space. It is crucial to avoid ascribing the same confidence level to different predicted models and ensure that we treat both these and experimental structures distinctly. Therefore, 3D-Beacons will provide provenance information and confidence measurements for predicted models using QMEAN. Additionally, the project also includes evaluating the applicability of structure-based annotations assembled in PDBe-KB (pdbe-kb.org) to related sequences and aims to derive a confidence measure for transferring these annotations.

## Expected outcomes

Objectives for the proposed hackathon:
The proposed hackathon will integrate further theoretical model provider data resources and scientific software with the 3D-Beacons network. The hackathon will aim to achieve the following:
1. Discussing and iterating on the standardised data exchange formats to suit the various data providers and users
2. Updating the 3D-Beacons Registry with the required meta-information on new data providers
3. Implementing/adjusting API endpoints according to the updated 3D-Beacons API specification
4. Integrating the 3D-Beacons client for processing and converting model files to data exchange format (.mmcif, .pdb)
5. Extending the 3D-Beacons Hub to establish connections with the new data provider beacons
Designing and implementing a prototype for transferring functional annotations to theoretical models based on sequence identity

## Expected audience

Anyone who has macromolecular models
Anyone who has an interest in data exchange format specifications

**Number of expected hacking days**: 4
