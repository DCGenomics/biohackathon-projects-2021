# Swiss Lipid IDs in Wikidata

Previously, we already proposed a [Swiss Lipid property for Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Property_proposal/SwissLipids_identifier)
which was approved and created in [just before the 2020 BioHackathon Europe](https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Property:P8691&oldid=1287579005).
But populating Wikidata with identifiers got stuck.

The intention for this BioHackathon is the add them, using SwissLipid ID <> InChIKey tuples and Bacting code. This page will describe the process.

## Step 1: getting the data

The data is CC-BY but it was agreed that adding the SwissLipid identifiers to Wikidata (CCZero) is okay.
