# Project 23: Improve Sapporo's interoperability with the implementation of Workflow Execution Service of Elixir and beyond

## Abstract

Through the past BioHackathons, we collaborate with multiple groups from Elixir nodes to improve our Workflow Execution Service (WES) called Sapporo. The Sapporo consists of two components: sapporo-service, a standard implementation of the GA4GH WES API standard, and sapporo-web, a web application for managing runs on WES services. The Sapporo components are available on GitHub and have made a major update recently. In this hackathon, we would like to ask participants to have discussions and help for each layer of Sapporo: (1) sapporo-web, (2) sapporo-service, (3) workflow platform running inside the sapporo-service. For (1) sapporo-web, we would like to perform the compatibility testing of sapporo-web for the other WES implementations. For (2) sapporo-service, we would like to develop the conformance test and the loading test of WES. We also would like to implement the authentication layer for sapporo-server, ensuring the GA4GH passport standard. For (3) workflow layer, we would like to import the existing tool registries such as nf-core, workflowhub.eu, and Common Workflow Library. We also would like to investigate the strategies for CI of workflow using WES. Through this hackathon, we hope to improve the interoperability of our platform with Elixir's implementations.
