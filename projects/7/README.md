# Project 7: Develop your quantum bioinformatics applications today with Quantum Learning Machine

## Abstract

In 2017, Atos launched the Atos Quantum Learning Machine, the highest performing quantum simulator in the world. It is a complete on-premise environment designed for developing quantum software. Its aim is to anticipate the future of quantum computing and to be prepared for opportunities such as superfast algorithms for database search, artificial intelligence, or the discovery of new pharmaceutical molecules. We firmly believe that quantum technologies can leap your bioinformatics applications to the next level, and we want to be the enablers of this shift by providing you not only with the access to the technology, but also experts that will coach you during the whole process. Atos presents this project as part of the HPC, AI and Quantum Life Sciences Centre of Excellence, an initiative to bring technologies closer to use cases in life sciences with the final aim of discovering fresh innovative solutions. We aim to accelerate the adoption of Quantum by offering the hackers the unique opportunity of having their hands on our Quantum Simulator.

## Expected outcomes

We acknowledge the degree of complexity of this project; therefore, we are open to any kind of deliverable or outcome. It can be a functional demo, a one pager describing your experience or even a video!
Timeframe: one week

## Expected audience

There are not predefined rules or constraints to embrace this challenge. You can play with Quantum on your own although we recommend do to it as part of a team. The only required skill is a restless and open mind. Note that your computing expertise might not be applicable to this new technology! Be prepared to explore an uncharted territory.
Good to select one or two applications

**Number of expected hacking days**: one week
